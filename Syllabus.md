## Description

_Published:_

This course explores the relationship between aesthetics and the emerging capabilities of digital technology. It will cover the historical relationship between science and art up to the end of the 20th century and examine the methodology of critical artistic applications.

_Revised:_

This course explores the relationship between aesthetics and the emerging capabilities of digital technology. This relationship will be explored through consideration of the reciprocal relationship between research and art. Students will be pushed to explore how this can influence their own practice and how arts-based research methods may allow their artistic practice to make a greater contribution to various communities.


## Objectives & Student Learning Outcomes

Through this course, students are expected to demonstrate an ability to:

- Discuss technical and aesthetic concerns within experimental art and technologically mediated art.
- Discuss the role of research in academia and art.
- Employ art-based research methods.
    - This includes;
        - Developing the capability to identify appropriate arts-based research methods.
        - Identifying and utilizing appropriate resources and tools.
- Analyze and validate peer research.
- Create artwork that is intimately connected with arts-based research.
- Create a written article resulting from arts-based research.

## Pre-Requisites

There are no pre-reqs for this course. This course is restricted to Media Arts MFA students.


## Books, Supplies, & Technology

### Books

I am going to ask you to purchase a number of texts this semester that relate to the topics of arts-based research and experimental art.

#### Recommended Books

- _Practice-Led Research, Research-Led Practice in the Creative Arts: Research Methods for the Arts and Humanities._ by Hazel Smith and Roger T. Dean, editors. Edinburgh University Press, 2009.
	- We will read extensively from this book. But I will make it available via the library if you want.
- _Academie X – Lessons in Art + Life_ by Marina Abramovic, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Dan Graham, and Studio Rags Media Collective (with content provided by 36 contemporary artists)
	- We will seldom read from this book.

### Other Texts

There will be a number of texts (conference/journal articles) assigned throughout the semester. When these are available freely through the UMT library you will be expected to acquire them yourselves. For articles that are not easily accessible via the library I will distribute those directly to you.

### Computer

You will need access to a computer capable of running modern digital art software, including but not limited to; video editing, digital audio workstation (DAW), code, game engines, etc. This computer should also be capable of real-time signal processing through analog inputs and outputs (i.e., using an audio interface or web cam). Please leverage departmental resources whenever necessary.

### Software

There is no specifically required software for this course. Instead, it is assumed that you will use the tools that make the most sense to your artistic process and desires. Where possible, you are encouraged to leverage departmental resources. However, as a graduate student, you may also need to make investments in tools and technologies throughout this course and your degree.

#### Reference Management Software

I suggest you start using a reference management software package of some sort. 

Suggested:

- Mendeley
- EndNote
- RefWorks




# Policies

## Course Evaluation

Student work and progress will be assessed through:

- In-class discussions and critiques
    - You are expected to engage with class discussions about technical and artistic issues.
    - You are expected to engage with class discussions about outside readings, viewing, and/or listenings.
    - This is mostly what this class will be about. So this part is critical.
    - You are expected to engage in class critique days.
- Projects
    - You are expected to create at least one significant artwork this semester that emerges as a result of your engagement with an arts-based research method.
    - This work may whatever media/medium you desire.
    - This is your opportunity to synthesis creative concerns and technical concerns from multiple weeks of content into a larger project.
- Project Documentation
	- Each project will require project documentation, including; a demo video, short written description, and supporting supplementary material where appropriate (script, score, schematics, etc.).
- Written Exegeses
    - You are expected to produce a paper.
    - This is an exegetical document that comes out of your research practice and creative practice for this semester.
    - This should be a paper appropriate for submission to a peer-reviewed academic conference or journal. (Regardless of whether the goal would be journal publication, oral presentation, or poster presentation)



#### Participation

This class will be participatory, and you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students.



## Grades

#### Final Grades

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

- In-class discussions and critiques: 30%
- Written Output & Research: 35%
- Artistic Work: 35%


Letters are assigned according to the following final course percentages:

| Grade | % Range 	|
|:-----:|:---------:|
| A  	| `[93-100]`|
| A- 	| `[90-93)`	|
| B+ 	| `[87-90)`	|
| B  	| `[83-87)`	|
| B- 	| `[80-83)`	|
| C+ 	| `[77-80)`	|
| C  	| `[73-77)`	|
| C- 	| `[70-73)`	|
| D  	| `[60-70)`	|
| F  	| `[0-60)`	|


#### Late Work

IMPORTANT: Since projects are experienced as a group in class or through a public presentation, late projects are not permissible and will not be accepted.

Documentation assignments or weekly sketches handed in after the due date and time will have points deducted for lateness. This will be in addition to any points deducted for content. Those that are uploaded late but within one day of the due date will lose 5% for lateness.  For those uploaded after that, the number of deducted points will be at the discretion of the professor.


## Attendance

- Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class
- Critique days are mandatory. No exceptions. No tardiness.
- Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. (email is preferred)
- Unexcused absences will affect your grade.
    - One unexcused absence is allowed; after that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 5% for each additional absence.
- You are expected to work with colleagues to catch-up on what you missed.


## Communication

If you must, email the instructor only via UM email. Let’s focus on talking in person. Be sure to check out my posted schedule on my office door and drop by.


## Time & Effort

This is a rigorous graduate course that requires appropriate time and effort weekly to earn 4 graduate credits.


## Plagiarism and Cheating Policy

Students are expected to adhere to academic conduct policies of the University of Montana as explained in Section V of your [University of Montana Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/Student%20Conduct%20Code%20-%20FINAL%20-%208-24-18.pdf):  “Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University.  Academic misconduct is defined as all forms of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to:  (1) plagiarism, (2) misconduct during an examination or academic exercise, (3) unauthorized possession of examination or other course materials, (4) tampering with course materials, (5) submitting false information, (6) submitting work previously presented in another course, (7) improperly influencing conduct, (8) substituting, or arranging substitution, for another student during an examination or other academic exercise, (9) facilitating academic dishonesty, and (10) Altering transcripts, grades, examinations, or other academically related documents.”

Dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. This includes, but is not limited to, cheating on tests, cheating on assignments, fabricating information or citations, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used, or tampering with the academic work of other students.

Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another without acknowledgment. As defined by the [University of Montana’s Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/default.php), plagiarism is “Representing another person's words, ideas, data, or materials as one's own.”  Students may use information and ideas expressed by others, but this use must be identified by appropriate referencing.

Students who cheat or plagiarize will receive academic sanctions, which may include an “F” grade on the assignment, examination, and/or in the course. Students will also be reported to the Dean of Students for possible further disciplinary action.

#### Using Code or Media Found Elsewhere

It is easy to find code and media (i.e. videos, sounds, images, etc.) online. If you use code or media from elsewhere (which you will at times), I expect you to cite the work and author.

If you use found code, you are expected to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. _Do not_ summarize several lines of code from a high level (i.e., TV Guide). I expect you to comment each line on a granular level. In addition, in these cases, I am also looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It is bending these concepts to your idea, especially graphically. It is not a copy and paste job. Also, never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period. If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assignment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

If you use found media, *YOU* are responsible to ensure it is used according to fair-use guidelines. The pieces you make in this course are intended to be portfolio-quality works. Therefore, you should not utilize found media with restrictive use guidelines or licenses. You can read more about various licenses at;

- [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/legal/)
- [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com)
- [GNU Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html)
- [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/)
- [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses)

For found media, you are also expected to cite the media in your documentation for the project.


## Sensitive Subject Matter & Censorship

This course operates under a no censorship policy, and you should feel free to experiment with challenging topics in your projects. That said - if you submit work with violent or sexually explicit themes, containing hate speech, racial slurs or other sensitive subject matter, I might contact you to request more background information on your choices.


## Be Kind

Be respectful to each other, help each other, and be considerate in your communications with the instructional team.  No trolling shared work and ideas. Be constructive with any critical feedback you give.


## Students with Disabilities

The University of Montana assures equal access to instruction through collaboration between students with disabilities, instructors, and Disability Services for Students. Students with disabilities are encouraged to plan ahead and can contact [Disability Services for Students (DSS)](http://www.umt.edu/dss/). If you think you may have a disability adversely affecting your academic performance, and you have not already registered with Disability Services, please contact Disability Services in Lommasson Center 154, or call (406)243-2243. I will work with you and Disability Services to provide an appropriate modification.


## Changes to the Course

I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.
