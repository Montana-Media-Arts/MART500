# Project Specifications for MART 500 - Core Research

Last updated: 9-9-2020

## Due Dates:

- Documentation of Artwork: Wednesday, November 11th
- Exegetical Document: Wednesday, November 11th
- Artistic Performance (where appropriate) or presentation, and talk of research: November 18th and 19th

## Description

As a student in MART 500 - Core Research, the primary assessment for your involvement with this course will occur through your creation, involvement, presentation, and submission of an original artwork or creative scholarship and associated exegetical document representing engagement in some form of practice-as-research.

The creative practice/scholarship or artifact should be (a) significant work relating to your area of study/interest within the MFA program. The approach, medium, style, genre, etc. that you choose to engage within is completely left to you the student to decide.

Through your creative work/practice, you should simultaneously engage in research following one of the following, general large approaches;

- practice-led research (where the research results emerge from document, analyzing and engaging in creative practice)
- practice-based research (where the research results are represented primarily through the resulting artifact)

> _Please see Skain, 2018 or the introduction from Smith and Dean, 2009 for more information about these two approaches_.

## Process

As you proceed through this work, generally, you should follow the proceeding order of operations:

1. Establish the Research Problem
   - The research problem can be established prior to engaging in creative practice, or as a result of questions that have arisen through creative practice.
   - If establishing the research problem first, then the creative practice should be designed to allow you to explore, test, and learn through the creative practice.
   - If the research problem emerges from creative practice, then you should determine how best to solve the problem, incorporate it back into the research, and then test its validity.
2. Conduct Background Research
   - After identifying both the research problem and domain of creative practice, you are expected to conduct background research in order to "as best you can" become a domain expert. You should know about any other artists, practitioners, researchers who have practiced the same, dealt with these questions/problems, or worked on similar projects.
   - This includes both work that supports your aims, as well as work that may be antithetical to your aims or desired outcomes.
   - This will obviously include both review of artistic products/works, as well as research outputs.
   - This should result in both an annotated bibliography, as well as a literature review.
3. Revisit Research Problem
   - After conducting a thorough review of related work and literature, you should revisit and reconsider your research problem in light of any new information or findings.
   - Affirm for yourself that the problem, as you have it stated, is the correct approach or question to ask.
4. Conduct Contextual Research or Continue Engaging in Creative Practice
   - After reconsidering the research problem, either; 1) continue engaging in creative practice to collect data and engage with the process, and/or 2) engaging in empirical research that identifies hypothesis, establishes single-variable experiments, and runs those experiments.
   - Document everything and keep journals
5. Form Argument Leading to Exegesis
   - After completing the formal creative practice, experiments, or related research (or as time dictates, which ever occurs first), analyze results, data, and findings in order to articulate arguments about the outcomes and finding from your research and practice.
6. Create Formal Documentation of Creative Practice or Artifact
   - Create an album, movie, video, prints, etc. of the resulting creative practice and/or artifact
7. Write the Exegesis
   - Write your document.
   - This will need to follow the form typical of and be styled according to the conference or journal you have identified as wanting to submit to.

## Deliverables

### Project Proposal

You are expected to deliver a formal project proposal that outlines the nature of the project, creative process or artwork, expected/desired/possible outcomes, timeline, and procedures you expect to follow.

This should be submitted as both;

- a written document (submitted as a PDF)
- a powerpoint style presentation (or whatever formal talk-like presentation that makes sense)

### Annotated Bibliography and Literature Review

After completing the background review, you are expected to submit an annotated bibliography and written literature review of your proposed topic. Additionally, you should restate or present a revised project problem and outcomes at the end of this document.

These should be submitted as a combined PDF.

### Proposed Submission Location

You are expected to submit a proposed submission location for this work. This can be a conference, gallery, journal, etc.

### Artifact or Documentation of Creative Practice

You should submit a representation of, or the actual resulting artistic artifact or documentation of creative practice.

### Exegetical Document

Finally, you are expected to submit a written exegesis. This document will discuss your process, research, problem, literature review, methods, and conclusions/findings.

This document should be formatted according to specifications for your identified submission location. Furthermore, this document should be submitted as an accessible PDF.
