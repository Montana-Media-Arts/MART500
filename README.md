## COURSE OVERVIEW

This course explores the relationship between aesthetics and the emerging capabilities of digital technology. This relationship will be explored through consideration of the reciprocal relationship between research and art. Students will be pushed to explore how this can influence their own practice and how arts-based research methods may allow their artistic practice to make a greater contribution to various communities.

This course will focus primarily on art-based research methods and how they can be used within the artistic process.
