## Paper Specification

Your paper, should describe your process, initial questions, results, and experience with your artwork. Use the literature on practice-based research methods from the beginning of the semester to help with this work.

**Formatting**

Please utilize a paper template of one of the conferences or journals you identified. 

## Talk/Presentation Specifications

Please plan first, showing your artwork to the class. _Since we are on Zoom, it will likely work best for all media files to be available for download, then students will watch synchronously, on their on devices._

You will follow this with 10-15 minute powerpoint presentation, which discusses your paper. 

This will be followed by 2-5 minutes of question. Each class member, is expected to ask at least one question.
